### Spelldle

## Idea

- A game where a random word is played, and your goal is to write that word correctly
- after spelling the word the correct letters are marked with orange background and the correct letters in the correct places are marked with green background
- will have 2 modes: daily and infinite
- infinite mode have a scoring mechanezim, and can see self leaderbord of previues runs
- in daily mode the words are generated using todaies seed
- user data are saved in local storage. in the future, we could add support for cloud saving
